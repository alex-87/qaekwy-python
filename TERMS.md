## 5. Liability & Indemnity

### 5.1 Disclaimer of Warranties

The Qaekwy cloud-based API (the “Service”) is provided “as is” and “as available,” without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or non-infringement. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Developer does not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure, or that defects will be corrected. You use the Service at your own risk.

### 5.2 Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Developer and its affiliates shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages (e.g., loss of profits, data, or goodwill) arising from the Service, whether based on contract, tort, or other legal theory, even if advised of such damages. As the Service is free, the Developer’s total liability for any claims is limited to zero euros (€0). In jurisdictions where limitations for gross negligence or willful misconduct are not permitted, liability is limited to the minimum required by law.

### 5.3 User Responsibility for Data

You are solely responsible for the security, backup, and integrity of data you transmit or process through the Service, as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws. The Developer is not liable for any loss, corruption, or unauthorized access to your data.

This obligation applies to the extent permitted by law and survives termination of your use of the Service.
